The battleship game we are gonna create will have the same rule 
as a traditional battleship game, but we can change some rules to
make the gameplay more fun. We will first code it without the use
of GUI, then later on, we can decide to remake this game using a 
GUI.

This game contains two parts. In the first part, we set up the position
for each ship. In the second part, we try to take out all the enemy ship
by putting bombs on the grid. The first one to take out all the opponent's
ships win the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
THE GAME BOARD
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The grid in battleship will be a 8 x 8 matrix (subjective to change).
Each square in the grid can be represented using "+", "-", "|". For example, this
is a 2 by 3 matrix:

+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
+---+---+---+
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
+---+---+---+

At the start, every square will be blank " ", meaning that the player or AI didn't put any
bombs on the grid yet. When the player plant a bomb on a grid, but there's no ship on it, 
we can use the "*" symbol, we can use the X symbol if the bomb hits a ship. Down below,
a A_1,1 has no ship when dropping the bomb, but A_2,2 has a ship which is wounded by the bomb.

+---+---+---+
| * |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   | X |   |
+---+---+---+

I am not sure how many, and what the size of ships would be in this game yet. It will be decided
later. The game board of this game will be represented by an argmented matrix, where the left
matrix is our board, and the right matrix is the AI's board. Ex:

Every time we plant a bomb in enemy's grid and the enemy plant a bomb in our grid, the game board
will be refreshed. Here's an example of me planting a bomb on A_1,3, and AI putting a bomb on
A_5,6.

When all the ship parts is wrecked, the ship will be destroyed and it will be surronded by "*".
Here's what it looks when a 1 by 2 size ship is destroyed on our board.

THE PLACEMENT OF SHIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't decided how many ships there will be and what their sizes are yet. 
When we place down a ship on the grid, we can't place another ship beside the
ship we placed. Below is a size 1 by 4 ship represented by "X", other ships can't 
be placed in the "-" area.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ENEMY AI
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was planning to create two difficulties for the AI: NORMAL and DIFFICULT.
I will put a PDF file for the probability density function used in difficult AI.

The normal game AI imitates the behaviour of a normal human player.
The difficult AI will calculate the probability of a ship on every single
squares on the grid, and bomb on the square that's most likely to contain 
a ship.

AI mode:
Each AI will have two mode: hunt mode and destroy mode. In the hunt mode, the
AI will be searching for ships that's not wounded or destroyed yet. 
Once the AI wound a ship with a bomb, the AI will reach destroy mode.
In destroy mode, the AI's objective is to destroy the ships instead of searching
for more ships.

Normal AI:
In hunt mode, the normal AI will randomly putting bombs on our grid to see if it
can wound any ships. When it reaches destroy mode, it will put bombs beside the ship
in order to destroy the entire ship. 

Difficult AI:
The AI search for the squares with most likely chance of having a ship, then it will
randomly bomb these areas that are equal most likely of having the ship. When it reach
destroy mode, it will also apply probability to see where the rest of the ship 
is most likely hidden in the grid and bomb those areas ramdomly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
THE NUMBER ON THE GRID
--------------------------------------------------------------------

0:  There is nothing on this square.
1:  The part of a carrier(C) is on this square.
2:  The part of a battleship(B) is on this square.
3:  The part of a cruiser(c) is on this square.
4:  The part of a submarine(s) is on this square.
-1: This square is beside a unsunk ship.
-2: This square is bombed by the enemy, but there's no ship on it.
-3: This square is bombed by the enemy, and the bomb hits part of the ship, but the ship has sunk yet.
-4: The square covered with -4 indicates the sunk ship and the squares beside the sunk ship.
